# Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)

The **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** is an interaction model and open standard for connecting buyers, their AI agents, and businesses to complete purchases seamlessly.

The specification is [maintained](MAINTAINERS.md) by **OpenAI** and **Stripe** and is currently in `draft`.

- **For businesses** Reach more customers. Sell to high-intent buyers by making your products and services available for purchase through AI agents—all while using your existing commerce infrastructure.
- **For AI Agents** - Embed commerce into your application. Let your users discover and transact directly with businesses in your application, without being the merchant of record.
- **For payment providers** - Grow your volume. Process agentic transactions by passing secure payment tokens between buyers and businesses through AI agents.

## 🛠 Getting Started

ACP has been **first implemented by both OpenAI and Stripe**, providing production-ready reference implementations for merchants and developers:

- [OpenAI Documentation](https://developers.openai.com/commerce/)
- [Stripe Agentic Commerce Documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/agentic-commerce)

To start building with ACP:

1. Review this repo's [OpenAPI specs](spec/openapi/) and [JSON Schemas](spec/json-schema/).
2. Choose a reference implementation:
   - Use OpenAI's implementation to integrate with ChatGPT and other AI agent surfaces.
   - Use Stripe's implementation to leverage its payment and merchant tooling.
3. Follow the guides provided in the linked documentation.
4. Test using the [examples](examples/) provided in this repo.
